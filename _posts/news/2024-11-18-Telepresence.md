Jiaji Su presented his work on a {% cite suTelepresence2024 %} on a pneumatically-driven soft continuum haptic device at the inaugural IEEE Telepresence conference held in Pasadena, CA. The device interfaces with a user's index finger and delivers sensory substitution by position feedback. This means the force feedback is converted to a position command displacing the user's finger. The user can then map this position to a force. 

By doing this we can decouple the force feedback (at the finger) from the position input (the hand) ensuring stable teleoperation even in the presence of delays. Additionally, we are able to display haptic feedback using a compact and lightweight handheld interface.
