The ERIE lab held our summer on-site team-building activities on campus. We discussed and iterated over our lab goals, while brainstorming solutions to some logistical challenges we faced as a growing lab. We also held break-out sessions, where students discussed their personal goals. We concluded with research presentations and then set off for Rock River for some kayaking! The goal is to have a team-building on-site every two years.

Check out the pictures below!

To mark the end of our summer research internships, the lab headed to the ice-cream social organized by President Kaler. We grabbed our favorite Mitchell's flavors and reflected on the accomplishments of Summer 24!
