![ERIE Lab Members and Friends](/images/lab_social_summer_2023.jpg)

ERIE lab members and their plus ones gathered for a BBQ at Edgewater Park. We had fun making setting up the grills, enjoying food and beverages, and played some Kubb, a team lawn game where you try to knock down pins using a stick. Thank you to Jiaji for being the grill master and to Kaiwen for making the Costco run!
