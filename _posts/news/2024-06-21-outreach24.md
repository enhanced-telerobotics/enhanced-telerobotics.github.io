ERIE Lab teamed up with Saphari Lab to host the Bay STEM Academy for a second year. Students saw our new lab space and tried different haptic experiences, ranging from soft pneumatic fingertip haptics, desktop force feedback systems, to vibrotactile feedback. We also upgraded our da Vinci Research Kit robot for better teleoperation demonstrations!
