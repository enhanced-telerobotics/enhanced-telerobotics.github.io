ERIE Lab members were out in full force at the International Conference of Intelligent Robots and Systems in Detroit, Michigan from October 1st-5th.

PhD students Yi Zhou Li and Sai Jiang participated as student volunteers to assist with running the conference smoothly.

PhD student Jiaji Su presented a demo of a 3+1 degree-of-freedom soft haptic device.

Undergraduate research Ray Le presented a late-breaking poster at the workshop "Debate: Data vs. Model in Medical Robotics" on contact-conditional visual force estimation. This work was done in collaboration with Shuyuan Yang a master's thesis student. Their work won 3rd place for best poster of the workshop.

Prof. Chua gave a talk at the same workshop on model-based and learning-based approaches to visual force estimation in teleoperation from the perspective of humans vs. robots.

The final dinner reception was held at the Henry Ford Museum and ERIE members had a fun time exploring the various interactive exhibits at the museum.
