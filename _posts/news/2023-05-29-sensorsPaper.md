Our paper on the design of an open-source, low-cost thee-degree-of-freedom force sensor for surgical robotics researchers has been published in MDPI Sensors {% cite chua2023modular %}. The repository for designs can be found [here](https://github.com/enhanced-telerobotics/RMIS_force_sensor), please feel free to reach out to Dr. Chua if you have questions about how to build these sensors. We are continuing work to improve the sensors so that they are more robust to manufacturing errors.
