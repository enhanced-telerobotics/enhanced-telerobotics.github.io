title:  "Haptic Feedback for Motor Learning"
teaser: "Much like how a tennis or golf coach can grasp your arm and haptically show you how to swing your arms to execute a shot, haptic systems can be programmed to do the same. We investigate how humans learn from haptic feedback and design methods to intelligently deliver this instruction through robotic systems."
