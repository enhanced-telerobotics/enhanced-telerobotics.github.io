teaser: "I am actively recruiting for PhD students to join in Fall 2023. I am also open to mentoring master's and undergraduate students for shorter-term projects who are interested in research or pursuing doctoral studies in robotics, mechatronics, haptics, and controls. Interested masters and undergraduate students can reach out to me via email directly. PhD students should apply through the university's application portal. <br><br> I am committed to building a work environment that supports and values people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Individuals from underrepresented backgrounds are highly encouraged to apply to be part of my research group."
